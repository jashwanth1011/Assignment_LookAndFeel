		   Compatability was achieved using elements like container, meta and making all the widths to 100% or auto. Regarding usabilty, we have followed apple by targeting very basic user assuming, he is new to the website.
		   We didn't use any special tags or elements in achieving this. Regarding content, as we are new to the business of Zumba studio, we have gone through many other websites that have the content we need and transformed it to our requirement. For design we have completely focused on css script inorder to achieve what we require. We have changed the colors, background images, font sizes, alignment to get to what we have planned.
